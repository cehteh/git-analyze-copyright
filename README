  git-analyze-copyright -- check and update copyright information

Uses git-blame to determine the author and year edited of each line
within the given files.

It can check if the year/author appears in an existing copyright
notice. This feature can be disabled with the '-n' option.

By default missing year/author is reported on stderr. The --append
option can be used to append notices to the end of the file (to be
properly formatted later).
